1 Preliminary information
*************************

The `bbe' program is a sed-like editor for binary files. `bbe' performs
basic byte related transformations on blocks of input stream. `bbe' is
non-interactive command line tool and can be used as a part of a
pipeline. `bbe' makes only one pass over input stream.

2 Samples using `bbe'
*********************

Few examples of running `bbe':

`bbe -b "/\x80\x50\x0e/:12" -e "d 0 3" -e "c BCD ASC" -e "I \x0a" -e "w /tmp/numbers" -o /dev/null /tmp/bdata'
     Task here is to extract BCD coded numbers from the file
     `/tmp/bdata' and write them in ascii format with newline to file
     `/tmp/numbers'.  12 bytes long blocks containing the BCD-numbers
     start with three byte sequence of values `0x80', `0x50' and
     `0x0e'. First three bytes (the block start sequence) are removed
     (`d 0 3') rest of the block is transformed from BCD to Ascii (`c
     BCD ASC') and a newline character is inserted at the end of the
     block (`I \x0a').  All transformed blocks are written to
     `/tmp/numbers' (`w /tmp/numbers'). Nothing is written to the
     output (`-o /dev/null').
`bbe -b ":525" -e "i 524 \x0a" -o /tmp/data_with_nl /tmp/data'
     A newline is added after every 525'th byte of the file
     `/tmp/data'. Data with newlines is written to `/tmp/data_with_nl'.
`bbe -b ":526" -e "d 525 1" -o /tmp/data /tmp/data_with_nl'
     Every 526'th byte (inserted newline in previous example) is
     removed from the file `/tmp/data_with_nl'. Data without newlines
     is written to `/tmp/data'.
`bbe -e "s/\x0d\x0a/\x0a/"'
     Same effect as has command `dos2unix'.

3 How to run `bbe'
******************

`bbe' accepts several commands to operate on blocks. Commands are
executed in the same order as they appear in command line or in a
script file.  Order is significant, because the changes made by
previous commands are seen by next commands.

3.1 Program invocation
======================

The format for running the `bbe' program is:

     bbe OPTION ...

   `bbe' supports the following options:

`-b BLOCK'
`--block=BLOCK'
     Block definition.

`-e COMMAND'
`--expression=COMMAND'
     Add command to the commands to be executed.

`-f SCRIPT-FILE'
`--file=SCRIPT-FILE'
     Add commands from SCRIPT-FILE to the commands to be executed.

`-o FILE'
`--output=FILE'
     Write output to FILE instead of standard output.

`-?'
`--help'
     Print an informative help message describing the options and then
     exit successfully.

`-V'
`--version'
     Print the version number of `bbe' and then exit successfully.

   All remaining options are names of input files, if no input files
are specified, then the standard input is read.

3.2 Block definition
====================

`bbe' devides the input stream to blocks defined by the `-b' option. If
block is not defined, the whole input stream is considered as one
block. Commands have effect only inside a block, rest of the input
stream remains untouched. Currently `bbe' supports only one block
definition per invocation. If input stream consists of different blocks,
several `bbe's can be combined in a pipeline.

   A block can be defined several ways:

`N:M'
     Block starts at offset N of input stream (first byte is 0). Block
     is M bytes long. This definition allows only one block to be
     defined.

`:M'
     The whole input stream is divided to M-size blocks.

`/START/:/STOP/'
     Blocks start with sequence START and end with sequence STOP. Both
     START and STOP are included to blocks.

`/START/:'
     Blocks start with sequence START and ends at next occurrence of
     START. Only the first START is included to block.

`:/STOP/'
     Blocks start at the beginning of input stream or after the end of
     previous block. Block ends at first occurrence of STOP.  Only the
     last STOP is included to blocks.

   It is possible to use c-like byte values in N, M, START and STOP.
Values in START and STOP must be escaped with `\', `\' can be escaped
as `\\'.

   Byte values can be expressed in decimal, octal or hexadecimal e.g.
in START and STOP:

`\123, \32 or \0'
     Decimal values

`\012, \08 or \0278'
     Octal values

`\x0a, \x67 or \xff'
     Hexadecimal values

   Values of N and M can be given in decimal, octal and hexadecimal:

`123, 32 or 112232'
     Decimal values

`0128, 08123 or 0'
     Octal values

`x456a, x167 or xffde'
     Hexadecimal values

3.3 `bbe' commands
==================

Commands in `bbe' can be divided in two groups: Block related commands
and byte related commands. Block related commands operate at block
level e.g. remove a block.  Byte related commands work allways inside a
block and they don't have effect beyond the block boundaries.

   Same escape codes for byte values in STRINGs can be used as in START
and STOP of block definition.

Block commands are:
-------------------

`A STRING'
     Write the STRING to output stream before the block.

`D [N]'
     Delete the N'th block. If N is not defined all blocks are deleted
     from output stream.  *Note*: First block is number one.

`I STRING'
     Write the STRING to output stream after the block.

`J N'
     Commands appearing after this command have no effect until N
     blocks are found. Means "Jump first N blocks".  *Note*: Commands
     that are defined before this command have effect on every block.

`L N'
     Commands appearing after this command have no effect after N
     blocks are found. Means "Leave blocks after N'th block".  *Note*:
     Commands that are defined before this command have effect on every
     block.

Byte commands are:
------------------

*Note*: The N in byte commands is offset from the beginning of current
block, first byte is number zero.

`c FROM TO'
     Converts bytes from FROM to TO. Currently supported formats are:
    `ASC'
          Ascii

    `BCD'
          Binary Coded Decimal
     *Note:* Bytes, that cannot be converted are passed through as they
     are. e.g. in ASC -> BCD conversion, ASCII characters not in range
     `'0'' - `'9'' are not converted.

`d N M'
     Delete M bytes starting from the offset  N.

`i N STRING'
     Insert STRING after byte number N.

`j N'
     Commands appearing after `j'-command have no effect concerning
     bytes 0-N of the block.

`l N'
     Commands appearing after `l'-command have no effect concerning
     bytes starting from the byte number N of the block.

`r N STRING'
     Replace bytes with STRING starting at the byte number N of the
     block.

`s/SEARCH/REPLACE/'
     All occurences of SEARCH are replaced by REPLACE. REPLACE can be
     empty. Separator `/' can be replaced by any character not present
     in SEARCH or REPLACE.

`w `file''
     Contents of blocks are written to file `file'. *Note*: Data
     inserted by commands `A' and `I' are not written to file `file'
     and `J' and `L' commands have no effect on `w'-commands.

`y/SOURCE/DEST/'
     Translate bytes in SOURCE to the corresponding bytes in DEST.
     SOURCE and DEST must have equal length.  Separator `/' can be
     replaced by any character not present in SOURCE or DEST.

3.4 Limitations
===============

At least in GNU/Linux `bbe' should be able to handle big files (>4GB),
other systems are  not tested.

   There are however, some limitations in block and command definitions:

_Strings in block definition_
_Search string in `s' command_
     are limited to _16384_ bytes.
_Total data to be inserted by `s' and `i' commands_
     is _245760_ bytes, that means the total data in command
     definitions, of course it can be inserted several times.

4 How `bbe' works
*****************

`bbe' scans the input stream just once, so the last block may differ
from the block definition, because `bbe' doesn't 'peek' the end of the
input stream. Last block may be shorter than defined, e.g. if block is
defined as `/string/:128' and if the end of input stream is found
before 128'th byte of the last block is reached, the last block remains
shorter.

Basic execution cycle:
----------------------

  1. Start of the block is searched. If found, data before block is
     written to output stream and step 2 is executed.

  2. Block commands affecting the start of the block (`A', `D' and `J')
     are executed.

  3. The block is scanned byte by byte and all byte commands (lower
     case letters) are executed.  *Note*: Commands are executed on
     results of previous commands, if e.g. the first byte of the block
     is deleted, the following  commands don't 'see' the removed byte.

  4. When end of the block is reached the end of the block commands
     (`I') are executed.

  5. Next block is searched, data between the blocks is written to
     output stream.

Few examples:
-------------

`echo "The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog" | bbe -b "/The/:21" -e "j 4" -e "s/ /X/"'
     Output is
          The quickXbrownXfoxXjumps over a lazy dog
     The only block in this is
          The quick brown fox j
     All spaces in the block are converted to X's, before conversion
     first 4 bytes are skipped.

`echo "The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog" | bbe -b ":/ /" -e "J 1" -e "I \x0a"'
     Output is:
          The quick
          brown
          fox
          jumps
          over
          a
          lazy
          dog
     All blocks end at space, a newline character is inserted after
     every block except the first block.

`echo "The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog" | bbe  -e "r 4 fast\x20" -e "s/f/c/"'
     Output is:
          The cast  brown cox jumps over a lazy dog
     Also the `f' in `fast' is converted to `c'.

`echo "1234567890" | bbe -b ":1"  -e "L 9" -e "I -"'
     Output is
          1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0
     Minus is inserted after every 1 byte long block,but not after 9'th
     block.
